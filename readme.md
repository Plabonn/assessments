# The basic concepts of programming are:

- Input/Output
- Variables/Arrays
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions 

### Input: 
Data or information that a system receives, like typing on a keyboard or clicking a mouse.

### Output: 
Data or information that a system sends out, like displaying text on a screen or printing a document.

### Variables:
A variable is a storage space in programming that holds a value, which can change. Think of it as a box with a label that stores data, like a number or a word.
#### Example:
x = 5 (Here, x is a variable holding the value 5.)

### Arrays:
An array is a collection of variables, stored together under one name, that can hold multiple values at once. Each value is accessed by its position (called an index). Think of it as a row of labeled boxes holding different values.
#### Example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4] (This array holds four values: 1, 2, 3, and 4.)

### Conditionals:
 In programming, conditionals are statements that allow a program to make decisions based on certain conditions. They check if something is true or false and then choose what action to take.

#### Example:

- If it's raining, then take an umbrella.

- Else, wear sunglasses.

### Loops: 
In programming, loops are used to repeat a set of instructions until a certain condition is met. They help run the same code multiple times without having to write it repeatedly.

### Functions: 
In programming, a function is a block of code that does a specific job. You can use it whenever you need, instead of repeating the same code.

## All the basic concepts Implemented in C++

### Input/Output:

#### Description of the code:

1. #include <iostream>:
This line includes the input-output stream library, which allows the program to use the cout object for displaying output.

2. using namespace std;:
This line enables the use of elements from the standard namespace (std) without needing to prefix them with std::.

3. int main() { ... }:
This defines the main function, which is where the program starts executing.

4. cout << "Hello World!";:
This line prints the text "Hello World!" to the console. The << operator is used to send the string to the output.

5. return 0;:
This indicates that the program finished successfully. Returning 0 signals no errors occurred.

Output: "Hello World!"

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```

### Variables/Arrays:

#### Description of the Code:
1. #include <iostream>:
This line includes the input-output stream library, which allows the use of cout for outputting data.

2. using namespace std;:
This line allows the program to use the standard namespace without needing to prefix standard functions and objects with std::.

3. int main() { ... }:
This defines the main function, where the program starts executing.

4. Variable:

- int age = 25;:
This line declares an integer variable named age and initializes it with the value 25. It stores the age of a person.
- cout << "Age: " << age << endl;:
This outputs the text "Age: " followed by the value of the age variable.

5. Array:

- int scores[5] = {90, 85, 88, 92, 95};:
This line declares an array named scores that can hold 5 integer values. It initializes the array with the scores 90, 85, 88, 92, and 95.
- cout << "Scores: ";:
This outputs the text "Scores: " before printing the array elements.

6. Loop:

- for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { ... }:
This loop iterates over the indices of the array from 0 to 4. It accesses each score in the scores array.
- cout << scores[i] << " ";:
Inside the loop, this prints each score followed by a space.

7. return 0;:
This indicates that the program completed successfully.

Output: Age: 25
Scores: 90 85 88 92 95 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Variable
    int age = 25;  // This variable stores the age of a person
    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;

    // Array
    int scores[5] = {90, 85, 88, 92, 95};  // This array stores 5 scores
    cout << "Scores: ";
    
    // Loop through the array to print the scores
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << scores[i] << " ";  // Print each score in the array
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Conditionals:

#### Description of the Code:
1. #include <iostream>:
This line includes the input-output stream library to use cout and cin.
2. using namespace std;:
This allows the program to use elements from the standard namespace without needing the std:: prefix.
3. int main() { ... }:
This defines the main function, where the program execution begins.
4. int number;:
This line declares an integer variable named number to store the userâ€™s input.
5. Input:

- cout << "Enter a number: ";:
This prompts the user to enter a number.
- cin >> number;:
This reads the user's input and stores it in the number variable.
6. Conditional Statements:

- if (number > 0) { ... }:
This checks if the number is greater than zero. If true, it outputs "The number is positive."
- else if (number < 0) { ... }:
If the first condition is false, this checks if the number is less than zero. If true, it outputs "The number is negative."
- else { ... }:
If both previous conditions are false, this block executes, outputting "The number is zero."
7. return 0;:
This indicates that the program completed successfully.

Output: When the program runs, it prompts the user to enter a number and then checks if the number is positive, negative, or zero, displaying the appropriate message based on the condition.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number;

    // Input: Get a number from the user
    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;

    // Conditional: Check if the number is positive, negative, or zero
    if (number > 0) {
        cout << "The number is positive." << endl;
    } else if (number < 0) {
        cout << "The number is negative." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "The number is zero." << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### Conditionals:

####  Description of the Code:
1. Input:

- number = int(input("Enter a number: ")):
This line prompts the user to enter a number. The input() function reads the input as a string, and int() converts it to an integer before storing it in the variable number.
2. Conditional Statements:

- if number > 0::
This checks if the number is greater than zero. If true, it executes the next line.
- print("The number is positive."):
This line prints "The number is positive." if the condition above is true.
- elif number < 0::
If the first condition is false, this checks if the number is less than zero. If true, it executes the next line.
- print("The number is negative."):
This line prints "The number is negative." if the condition above is true.
- else::
